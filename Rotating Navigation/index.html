          Iron Man, a Marvel Comics superhero, epitomizes genius billionaire
          Tony Stark's transformation into a technologically advanced hero.
          First debuting in 1963, Iron Man is known for his iconic powered
          armor, granting him superhuman strength and an array of high-tech
          weaponry. Stark's ingenuity and charismatic personality are as

          The character's popularity soared with Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal
          in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, solidifying Iron Man's place as a
          beloved and influential superhero in both comic books and blockbuster
          films.
